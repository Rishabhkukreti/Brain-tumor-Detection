# Brain-tumor-Detection
Abstract—  A brain tumor is an unusual growth of lump or tissue inside the brain or central spine that can mess up proper brain functioning and other body organ controlled by brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the common way used for brain imaging. It is used for analysing internal structures of brain in detail. Watershed segementation algorithm is one of the typical used image segmentation technique for brain MRI and primarily useful with MRI images to separate different parts and region detection. The aim of this paper is to extract tumor region from the brain MRI image by using marker based watershed algorithm which is based on different attributes combinations such as Pre-processing of the image that makes it ready for applying the watershed segmentation. Pre-processing includes image resizing, conversion of image to gray,image segmentation, colour, edge, orientation and texture.
